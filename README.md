I'll demonstrate here some simulations generated with the model. 

<h2>Normal immune function</h2>

Here is how the immune system deals with an antigen when no autoimmune disease is present.

<ul>
  <li>Yellow cells are spaces occupied by the antigen (i.e. the foreign material that the immune system has to attack)</li>
<li>Red cells are T-Cells that have not been activated (they move by brownian motion)</li>
<li>Green cells are T-Cells that have been activated and move to places of high inflammation through chemotaxis</li>
<li>Blue cells are cells where B-Cells have created antibodies against the antigen</li>
</ul>


<h2>Autoimmune disease case</h2>

Here is a case where there's an autoimmune disease.

In such a situation, T-Cells are activated really fast, since they recognize healthy tissue as material to be attacked. Also, since they create inflammation in healthy tissue, they get distracted, and cannot attack the antigen in an efficient way.
